# EULife-NLP-analysis


The following project will focus on the analysis of data from the EU LIFE programme. The LIFE programme is the EU's instrument for the funding of projects in the field of climate and environmental action. I have scraped data from the EU LIFE project repository, containing details on the 5000+ projects that this programme has funded throughout its 29 years of activity. 

The whole data scraping and assembly procedure can be found in the notebook labelled: **Web_scraping_and_dataset_assembly.ipynb**
The NLP analysis can instead be found in the notebook labelled: **NLP_analysis.ipynb**

## Project Overview
The overarching aim of this project is to gather a better understanding of how the EU is supporting the efforts to protect the environment. Specifically, this analysis sets iteslf the goal to:
1. Understand the topical areas in which the EU is active in funding projects that protect nature 
2. How the patterns of funding have evolved thoughout the time in which these type of investments have been active
3. How these contributions differ across varios parts of the world.
